========================================================

Repository Contents
-------------------

This repository contains the source-code for the tutorial [Up and flying with the AR.Drone and ROS: Getting started](http://robohub.org/up-and-flying-with-the-ar-drone-and-ros-getting-started/).

In the downloads section, you will also find the supporting [virtual machine image](https://github.com/downloads/mikehamer/ardrone_tutorials_getting_started/ARDroneUbuntu.ova), which includes all software and source-code required to run this tutorial.

Tutorial Overview
-----------------

In this tutorial (#1) we will:
1. Install ROS, the AR.Drone driver and AR.Drone keyboard controller
2. Fly the AR.Drone using the provided keyboard controller

In tutorials 2-5, we will:
2. Modify the keyboard controller to work with a joystick or control pad, giving much finer control (coming late December)
3. Look more closely at the data sent back from the drone and play with the on-board tag detection (coming early January)
4. Write a controller for the drone which allows us to control drone velocity, rather than body angle (coming late January)
5. Look at computer vision applications using some existing ROS packages (coming early February)
